# ASCII Key Generation 

VOL1

Created levels with ASCII Keys: added witch that follows. Supposed to colliding with the witch causes a game over. Player is also moving on a grid based movement.

Need to fix: Player collisions. Grid movement is messing with the box collider.

VOl2

Tried to fix collisions with Scriptable Tiles (still not working).

VOL3

Fixed player movement, got rid of grid-based movement to fix collisions. Now player moves in 4 directions only. Added some shaders/collision actions for witch collisions. Will add more for specific game object collisions i.e. trees, the player.

VOL4

Added more shaders and a starting screen. Also scene transitions. Need to now build more levels and add jumpscares + butter point system.
